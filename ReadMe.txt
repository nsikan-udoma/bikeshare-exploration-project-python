INTRODUCTION
In this project, I made use of Python to explore data related to bike share systems for three major cities in the United States—Chicago, New York City, and Washington. 
I wrote several lines of code to import the data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics. 
I also write a script that takes in raw input to create an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

SOFTWARES USED
Most of my scripting was done on jupyer notebook.
I installed python, numpy, and pandas using Anaconda
I downloaded the text editor Atom, which i used to create the final .py file
I used git bash for windows as my terminal application to view the .py project file to ensure that it runs without errors.

STATISTICS COMPUTED
I learned about bike share use in Chicago, New York City, and Washington by computing a variety of descriptive statistics. 
In this project, I wrote several lines of code to provide the following statistics:

#1 Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)
- most common month
- most common day of week
- most common hour of day

#2 Popular stations and trip
- most common start station
- most common end station
- most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

#3 Trip duration
- total travel time
- average travel time

#4 User info
- counts of each user type
- counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
- earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
